=============

Just some IPython notebooks that I've been using to learn how to do MCMC with PyMC.

You can either clone/branch/download this code and then view it in IPython, or you can view each notebook online here with nbviewer.

* [Baye's Equation example](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/drbenvincent/learning-pymc/blob/master/BayesEquation.ipynb). 
* [Linear regression example](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/drbenvincent/learning-pymc/blob/master/linear_regression.ipynb)
